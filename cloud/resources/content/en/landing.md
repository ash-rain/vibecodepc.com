faq:
  title: "Frequently asked questions"
  subtitle: "Everything you need to know about VibeCodePC."
  items:
    - question: "Do I need to know Linux to use this?"
      answer: "No. The entire setup is guided through a web-based wizard. You never need to touch the terminal unless you want to."
    - question: "Can I use it without an internet connection?"
      answer: "Yes. The device works fully offline for local development. You only need internet to validate AI API keys during initial setup (which gracefully degrades) and to deploy projects to the web."
    - question: "What AI services does it support?"
      answer: "OpenAI (ChatGPT/GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), GitHub Copilot, OpenRouter (access to dozens of models), and HuggingFace. You bring your own API keys — we don't resell AI access or take a cut."
    - question: "Is the software open source?"
      answer: "The device software will be open-sourced after launch. The cloud platform (vibecodepc.com) is proprietary. Backers get early access to the source code."
    - question: "Can I use my own Raspberry Pi?"
      answer: "We plan to release the device image for download after launch. However, the Kickstarter rewards include the full hardware bundle with custom enclosure, pre-flashed NVMe drive, and QR pairing — the complete experience."
    - question: "What's the $5/month subscription for?"
      answer: "The Starter plan gives you a personal subdomain (yourname.vibecodepc.com), HTTPS tunneling to deploy your projects to the web, and community support. Local development is completely free with no subscription required."
    - question: "How much power does it use?"
      answer: "About 15 watts under typical load. That's roughly $1–2/month in electricity to run 24/7, depending on your local rates."
    - question: "Can I connect a monitor and keyboard directly?"
      answer: "Yes. The Raspberry Pi 5 has 2× micro-HDMI and USB ports. You can use it headless (browser-based) or with a direct display. Most users prefer the browser-based VS Code experience since it's accessible from any device on their network."
    - question: "What happens if VibeCodePC (the company) goes away?"
      answer: "Your device keeps working. It's a Raspberry Pi running open-source software on your desk. The cloud features (subdomain, tunneling) would stop, but your hardware, code, and local development environment are yours forever."
