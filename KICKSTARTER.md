## Campaign Story

### The Problem

Setting up a development environment is painful. Installing dependencies, configuring editors, wrangling Docker, provisioning servers — most developers spend hours (or days) just getting ready to write their first line of code.

Cloud-based dev tools solve this, but come with monthly bills, usage limits, and the nagging feeling that your code lives on someone else's computer.

The Raspberry Pi is incredible hardware — but out of the box, it's a blank slate. Setting one up as a proper dev machine takes Linux expertise most people don't have.

**What if your development machine came ready to go?**

### Introducing VibeCodePC

VibeCodePC is a **Raspberry Pi 5 (16 GB)** in a custom enclosure, pre-loaded with everything you need to build and deploy software with AI assistance.

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Plug it in** — Connect power and Ethernet. That's it.
2. **Scan the QR code** — The QR printed on the device opens a setup page on your phone. Create your account and claim your device in 30 seconds.
3. **Walk through the wizard** — A guided setup connects your AI services (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and more). Your API keys are encrypted and stored locally on the device — they never leave your desk.
4. **Start building** — VS Code opens in your browser, pre-configured with extensions and AI assistance. Pick a project template (Laravel, Next.js, Astro, Python, static HTML) and start coding immediately.
5. **Deploy to the web** — One click deplishes your project to `yourname.vibecodepc.com` over a secure HTTPS tunnel. Toggle deployments on and off from the dashboard.

**From box to deployed project in under 5 minutes.**

### What's in the Box

- **Raspberry Pi 5** (16 GB RAM) in a custom-designed enclosure
- **128 GB NVMe SSD** — fast, reliable storage for your projects and tools
- **USB-C power supply** (27W)
- **Ethernet cable** (1m)
- **QR code card** with your unique Device ID
- **Quick start guide**

### Pre-Installed Software

Everything is configured and ready to use on first boot:

- **VS Code** (code-server) — full Visual Studio Code in your browser
- **AI integrations** — connect OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub Copilot, OpenRouter, HuggingFace
- **Docker** — for project isolation and containers
- **Node.js 22 LTS** + npm/pnpm
- **PHP 8.4** + Composer
- **Python 3.12** + pip
- **Git** — pre-configured
- **SQLite** — lightweight database, ready to go
- **Redis** (Valkey) — caching and queues built in
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** — secure web deployment, no port forwarding needed

### Why VibeCodePC?

**Your hardware, your data.** Everything runs on your desk. Your code, your API keys, your projects — none of it touches a cloud server unless you choose to deploy.

**No monthly compute bills.** The Raspberry Pi 5 draws about 15 watts. Run it 24/7 for roughly $1.50/month in electricity. Your projects stay live, your tunnels stay open, and your AI tools stay connected.

**AI-first development.** This isn't a Raspberry Pi with a text editor. VibeCodePC is built around AI-assisted coding from the ground up. The setup wizard walks you through connecting your AI services, and every project template comes pre-wired for AI assistance.

**Always on, always ready.** Leave it running on your desk. When inspiration strikes at 2 AM, open your laptop, navigate to your device's local address, and your entire development environment is waiting exactly where you left it.

**Zero Linux expertise required.** You don't need to know what `apt-get` does. The guided wizard handles everything. If you can scan a QR code and paste an API key, you can use VibeCodePC.

### Who Is This For?

- **Indie hackers and solo developers** who want a dedicated, always-on dev machine that isn't their laptop
- **People learning to code** who want a self-contained environment that just works
- **Vibe coders** — the growing wave of non-traditional developers using AI to build real software
- **Self-hosters** who want to run their own services without the pain of server administration
- **Educators and bootcamps** who need consistent, pre-configured development environments for every student

### The Platform: vibecodepc.com

VibeCodePC isn't just hardware — it's a platform.

Every device connects to `vibecodepc.com` through a secure Cloudflare Tunnel. This gives you:

- **A personal subdomain** — `yourname.vibecodepc.com`
- **HTTPS by default** — every deployment is secure, automatically
- **Dashboard control** — manage deployments, monitor your device, update software
- **Community** — join other VibeCodePC users on Discord, share projects, get help

The base hardware works completely offline. The platform subscription ($5/month Starter plan) is optional and only needed if you want to publish projects to the web.

## Risks and Challenges

**Supply chain.** Raspberry Pi 5 availability has stabilized significantly since its launch. We've established relationships with authorized distributors and will place component orders immediately upon funding. We're building buffer stock into our timeline — our October 2026 estimate accounts for potential 4-6 week supply delays.

**Custom enclosure manufacturing.** We've completed the enclosure design and have quotes from two injection molding manufacturers. First article samples will be ordered within 2 weeks of funding. We have a 3D-printed fallback enclosure design that meets all thermal and functional requirements if molding timelines slip.

**Software readiness.** The device software is actively in development. The cloud platform (vibecodepc.com) is live with a working waitlist. The device app architecture, identity system, and shared packages are complete. The wizard and dashboard are in active development. We're building in public — backers will have access to our GitHub repository and development updates.

**NVMe SSD sourcing.** We're specifying widely available M.2 2230/2242 NVMe drives from major manufacturers (Samsung, Western Digital, Kingston). These are commodity components with multiple sourcing options.

**Shipping.** We'll ship from a US-based fulfillment center. International backers should expect additional customs/duties fees which are not included in pledge amounts. We'll provide tracking for all shipments.

**What could go wrong.** Hardware projects are hard. We're mitigating risk by building on proven, widely-available components (Raspberry Pi 5 is not custom silicon) and keeping our software stack on battle-tested open-source foundations (Laravel, VS Code, Docker, Cloudflare). Our team has experience shipping physical products and managing hardware supply chains.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know Linux to use this?**
A: No. The entire setup is guided through a web-based wizard. You never need to touch the terminal unless you want to.

**Q: Can I use it without an internet connection?**
A: Yes. The device works fully offline for local development. You only need internet to validate AI API keys during initial setup (which gracefully degrades) and to deploy projects to the web.

**Q: What AI services does it support?**
A: OpenAI (ChatGPT/GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), GitHub Copilot, OpenRouter (access to dozens of models), and HuggingFace. You bring your own API keys — we don't resell AI access or take a cut.

**Q: Is the software open source?**
A: The device software will be open-sourced after launch. The cloud platform (vibecodepc.com) is proprietary. Backers get early access to the source code.

**Q: Can I use my own Raspberry Pi?**
A: We plan to release the device image for download after launch. However, the Kickstarter rewards include the full hardware bundle with custom enclosure, pre-flashed SSD, and QR pairing — the complete experience.

**Q: What's the $5/month subscription for?**
A: The Starter plan gives you a personal subdomain (`yourname.vibecodepc.com`), HTTPS tunneling to deploy your projects to the web, and community support. Local development is completely free with no subscription required.

**Q: How much power does it use?**
A: About 15 watts under typical load. That's roughly $1-2/month in electricity to run 24/7, depending on your local rates.

**Q: Can I connect a monitor/keyboard directly?**
A: Yes. The Raspberry Pi 5 has 2x micro-HDMI and USB ports. You can use it headless (browser-based) or with a direct display. Most users prefer the browser-based VS Code experience since it's accessible from any device on their network.

**Q: What happens if VibeCodePC (the company) goes away?**
A: Your device keeps working. It's a Raspberry Pi running open-source software on your desk. The cloud features (subdomain, tunneling) would stop, but your hardware, code, and local development environment are yours forever.
